# Tradeoffs-cellular-prediction
Reproduce the figures of \[DOI]

This repo contains all Mathematica notebooks (Version No. 13.2.1.0, Platform MAC OS X ARM 64 bit) generating the figures of the 'Trade-offs between cost and information in cellular prediction' main text and SI. To create a figure run the corresponding notebook (or only the initialization cells) using Mathematica. Figures are exported within the notebook folder in both svg and pdf format.

Note that fig 1 is omitted since it is purely conceptual.
